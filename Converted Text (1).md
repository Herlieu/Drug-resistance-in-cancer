Introduction

The inherent capacity of all organisms to evolve under selective pressure has created multidrug-resistant microbes and cells that are now threatening decades of progress in human health introduced by the advent of antibiotics. This resistance is developed by all pathogens, from bacteria to cancer cells, through fungi, parasites, or the seemingly simpler entities, i.e., viruses (Ramos-Martín and D’Amelio, 2023).

Drug resistance occurs when cancer cells or microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, don’t respond to a drug that is usually able to kill or weaken them. Drug resistance may be present before treatment is given or may occur during or after treatment with the drug (National Cancer Institute). 

Cancer

According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from 2019, cancer is currently the second-leading cause of death worldwide. Globally, an estimated 9600 thousand deaths are attributed to cancer worldwide, representing 1 in every 6 deaths (WHO)

 The identification of both affordable and efficient cancer treatments remains an important goal for both researchers and clinicians. Currently, chemotherapy is viewed as one of the most promising cancer treatments modalities for reducing the cancer burden. However, chemotherapy fails in nearly 90% of cases because tumor cells develop resistance against the anticancer agent, resulting in increased cancer invasion the progression to metastases, which increases the difficulty of treating cancer effectively (Goodman et al, 1946).

 Although many anticancer drugs exhibit remarkable efficacy during primary treatment, drug resistance often develops in many cancer patients as treatment progresses (ErzaMclendzZhong et al., 2021; Choudhari et al., 2020).

Drug Resistance

Drug resistance in cancer is an intimate occurrence that results when cancer becomes tolerant of pharmaceutical treatment (Mansoori et al., 2017). An extensive range of factors contributes to the development of resistance against anticancer drugs, including genetic mutations, altered epigenetics, enhanced drug efflux, and various changes in other molecular and cellular mechanisms, including the activation of specific signaling pathways (Mansoori et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2011; Arora et al., 2013).

Multi-Drug Resistance

In the field of cancer treatment, MDR is defined as the ability of cancer cells to survive treatment with a variety of anticancer drugs (Zahreddine and Borden, 2013), similar to the concept commonly applied to antibiotic treatment.

Growing evidence suggests that MDR is mediated by the increased efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs, which reduces the drug absorption by cancer cells (Sampath et al., 2006). The mechanism of MDR may also be mediated by the release of drugs outside of the cells. MDR may develop due to oncogene mutations, changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor heterogeneity, target site mutations, or epigenetic changes (Xue et al., 2018; Yeldag et al., 2018).

Conclusion 

The effectiveness of chemotherapy is significantly limited by the expression of MDR genes, which play key molecular and cellular roles in the induction of resistance against anticancer agents. Drug resistance can occur due to genetically unstable human cancer cells, and can either present before treatment (intrinsic) or develop after therapy (acquired). It is responsible for most cancer relapses (Emran et al., 2022).
